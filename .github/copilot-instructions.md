# GitHub Copilot Instructions
Only one html file should be present in the repository.

This is a website meant to showcase the projects I have worked on and the blog posts that I have written.

It should always be comprised of 3 main sections:

**Introduction Section**: This section should contain the text "Hi, I am Aswin G", a photo and links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and my blog.
These are the links to be used:
- GitHub: https://github.com/agzuniverse
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/agzuniverse/
- Blog: https://medium.com/@agzuniverse

The photo must be https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22353313?s=460&v=4

**Projects Section**: This section should contain a list of my projects, each with a title, description, and a link to the project.
**Blog Section**: This section should contain a list of my blog posts, each with a title, description, and a link to the post.

The website should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

The images in ./static/images can be unused, but if you want to use them, feel free to do so.

The website should be styled using only CSS, no frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind should be used.
